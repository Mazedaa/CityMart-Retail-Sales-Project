# CityMart Sales Project

## Project Background
As a Data Analyst at CityMart, I analysed retail sales data from 2023, concentrating on three key product categories: Beauty, Clothing, and Electronics. The goal was to identify sales patterns, customer preferences, and seasonal trends that could optimise inventory, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer engagement.

## Executive Summary
This analysis revealed key insights into sales, customer behaviour, and product performance:
  - Peak Sales: Occurred in May and October, driven by demand for Electronics and Beauty products.
  - Customer Demographics: Females spent more on Beauty and Clothing, while males outspent females in Electronics.
  - Product Preferences: The 18-23 age group favoured Beauty and Clothing, while the 60-64 age group spent the most on Electronics.
These findings offer a basis for refining marketing campaigns, optimising inventory, and enhancing customer engagement.

## Insights Deep-Dive
### 1. Seasonal Trends
  - Peak Sales: Highest sales in May (£53,150) and October, driven by Electronics and Clothing.
  - Low Sales: March and September recorded lower sales, presenting an opportunity for targeted promotions.
### 2. Gender-Based Insights
  - Females: Spent £232,840, dominating Beauty and Clothing purchases.
  - Males: Spent £223,160, primarily on Electronics, particularly high-value items.
### 3. Age-Based Insights
  - 18-23 Age Group: £69,235 in spending, with strong preferences for Beauty and Clothing.
  - 60-64 Age Group: £44,815 in spending, with significant high-value Electronics purchases.
### 4. Product Category Performance
  - Beauty: £143,515 in sales, peaking in July with preference from the 18-23 age group.
  - Clothing: £155,580 in sales, peaking in May, driven by the 18-29 age group.
  - Electronics: £156,903 in sales, peaking in May, with notable spending from the 60-64 age group.
### 5. Pricing Trends
  - Affordable Range (£25–£50): Steady demand, particularly in Clothing.
  - Premium Range (£300–£500): High sales in Electronics and Clothing during May and December.

## Recommendations
### Leverage Seasonal Peaks:
  - Target campaigns in May and October, focusing on Electronics and Beauty.
  - Use flash sales in March and September to stimulate low-demand periods.
### Gender-Focused Marketing:
  - Promote Beauty and Clothing for females, offering personalised discounts.
  - For males, focus on high-value Electronics, emphasising new features or product bundles.
### Age-Specific Campaigns:
  - 18-23: Target this group with digital campaigns for Beauty and Clothing.
  - 60-64: Highlight Electronics with a focus on product reliability, warranties, and ease of use.
### Cross-Selling Opportunities:
  - Bundle Beauty and Clothing, or Electronics and Accessories, to increase average transaction value.
### Inventory Optimisation:
  - Ensure sufficient stock of Beauty products in July, Electronics in May and December.
  - Avoid overstocking in low-demand months by forecasting based on historical trends.
## Key Questions for Stakeholders
### Seasonal Promotions: Should we focus more on increasing campaigns in May and October or explore strategies for traditionally low-sales months?
### Demographic Targeting: Are there additional data points (e.g., income or location) that would improve targeting accuracy?
### Cross-Selling: How can we implement incentives to encourage purchases across multiple categories?
## Assumptions and Caveats
This analysis is based on synthetic data, which may not reflect real-world nuances (e.g., regional economic factors).
Seasonal trends assume consistent marketing efforts, which may not have been the case in past years.
Insights are limited to the demographic factors of age and gender; additional factors like income or location were not available.

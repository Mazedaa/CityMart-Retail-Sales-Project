# CityMart Sales Project

## Project Background
#### As a Data Analyst at CityMart, I analysed retail sales data from 2023, concentrating on three key product categories: Beauty, Clothing, and Electronics. The objectives was to identify sales patterns, customer preferences, and seasonal trends that could optimise inventory, refine marketing strategies, and improve customer engagement.

## Executive Summary
This analysis revealed key insights into sales, customer behaviour, and product performance:
   - Peak Sales: Occurred in May and October, driven by demand for Electronics and Beauty products.
   - Customer Demographics: Females spent more on Beauty and Clothing, while males outspent females in Electronics.
   - Product Preferences: The 18-23 age group favoured Beauty and Clothing, while the 60-64 age group spent the most on Electronics.

These findings offer a basis for refining marketing campaigns, optimising inventory, and enhancing customer engagement.

## Insights Deep-Dive
### 1. Seasonal Trends
  - Peak Sales: Highest sales in May (£53,150) and October, driven by Electronics and Clothing.
  - Low Sales: March and September recorded lower sales, presenting an opportunity for targeted promotions.


### 2. Gender-Based Insights
  - Females: Spent £232,840, dominating Beauty and Clothing purchases.
  - Males: Spent £223,160, primarily on Electronics, particularly high-value items.
### 3. Age-Based Insights
  - 18-23 Age Group: £69,235 in spending, with strong preferences for Beauty and Clothing.
  - 60-64 Age Group: £44,815 in spending, with significant high-value Electronics purchases.
### 4. Product Category Performance
  - Beauty: £143,515 in sales, peaking in July with preference from the 18-23 age group.
  - Clothing: £155,580 in sales, peaking in May, driven by the 18-29 age group.

### 5. Pricing Trends

  - Premium Range (£300–£500): High sales in Electronics and Clothing during May and December.

## Recommendations
#### 1. Leverage Seasonal Peaks: Focus campaigns on Electronics and Beauty in May and October, and use flash sales in March and September to boost low-demand periods.
#### 2. Gender-Focused Marketing: Offer personalized discounts on Beauty and Clothing for females, while promoting high-value Electronics for males with an emphasis on new features and bundles.
#### 3. Age-Specific Campaigns: Target 18-23-year-olds with digital campaigns for Beauty and Clothing, and 60-64-year-olds with Electronics, highlighting reliability, warranties, and ease of use.
#### 4. Cross-Selling Opportunities: Bundle Beauty with Clothing and Electronics with Accessories to increase transaction value.
#### 5. Inventory Optimisation: Stock up on Beauty products in July and Electronics in May and December, while preventing overstocking in low-demand months through data-driven forecasting.

## Key Questions for Stakeholders
  - Should we focus more on increasing campaigns in May and October or explore strategies for traditionally low-sales months?
  - Are there additional data points (e.g., income or location) that would improve targeting accuracy?
  - How can we implement incentives to encourage purchases across multiple categories?

## Assumptions and Caveats
1. This analysis is based on synthetic data, which may not reflect real-world nuances (e.g., regional economic factors).
2. Seasonal trends assume consistent marketing efforts, which may not have been the case in past years.
3. Insights are limited to the demographic factors of age and gender; additional factors like income or location were not available.
